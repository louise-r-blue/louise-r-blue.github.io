            When it came to redesigning the site I realized I was not thinking mobile first. To this point I had relied on the mormalize and skeleton frameworks but also had to rely on my skills of editing out - content and elements - less is more. However having not looked at the blog site for a while until yesterday I notice elements had mysteriously moved. Well there really probably is no mystery just a missing css rule, perhpas a rule I edited out by mistake. Lesson leart - account for every change you make.

            Mmme - my chocie of buudy for the mindfulness coversation was none too pleased at the thought of a controlled 3 minute chat ( their words). I secretly thought that I could record with buddy un-aware but that is not very good mindfulness. The thing is - my buddy can usually speak for longer than 3 minutes.

            I like to walk but think too much at the same time. Perhaps breathing. I like the idea of taking or being concious of taking at least one good inhale and exhale of air a day.
