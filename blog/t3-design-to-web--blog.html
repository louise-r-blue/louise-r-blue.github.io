      A responsive site is one which adjusts and scales appropriatly to the users choice of device and screen resolution. The device could be a desktop, tablet or smartphone while screen resolutions range from 400px x ...to .... A responsive site uses one set of code to service all the users devices and screen resolutions. A responsive site must also take in to consideration the users viewing environment - such as indoor and  outdoor conditions, slow and fast connection speeds.
      </p>

      <p>Responsive sites are becoming increasingly important as users are accessing a varied and growing range of devices. One of the challenges for a responsive site is with mobiles and touch screens. Users use fingers as navigational tools on a mobile - choice of button size and position becomes paramount.</p>

        Wireframes are basic sketch ups of web pages that make up a web site. With little to no text they provide the developers and designers a visualisation of a pages starting point.
        Nothing is set in stone so this wireframe can be modified at any time.
