        My first thought was why not teach this in schools from a very young age. I know I would certainly have benefited from strengthening my emotional intelligence at a younger age. Then my next thought is I have the opportunity now and what is even better I am with a team of people who will be practicing along side me.

        The learnings I took from chapter 1 of 'Search Inside Yourself' include but not limited to:
      </p>

        <ul>

          <li>Emotional intelligence is obtainable for all of us - through mindfulness and mediative practice and techniques.</li>
          <li>To begin the practice we 'train attention'. Learn to see ourselves objectively.</li>
          <li>That space between emotional stimulus and response is our opportunity to be objective of ourselves, to let go of and edit some thoughts. This space is 'pause' for thought.</li>
          <li>I particulary liked this - that mindfulness is the mind of just being.</li>

        </ul>

        I only recently dsicovered a fact about stress. We all know stress can make us ill but in my ignorance I really did not know how. The fact is when we find ourselves in stressful situations parts of our body begin to shutdown such as the digestive system. Energy is diverted to the stressful moment. I have not articualted that very well but I hope you get the gist of it.

        How do I relate that to mindfulness and mediation. I believe it is all connected - healthy body equals healthy mind. The chapter does suggest mindfulness for the body.

        I would like to say with the click of a switch I was totally immersed in focusing on my breathing, but I was not. Birds were chirping outside. A car screamed up the road, a lawn mower in the distance... It will take practice but I am ready.
