           Since we pair programmed this week on a quote-generator app I will sum Chapter 5 learnings in quotes.

      <h3 class = "para-header">2 Minutes of Mindfulness</h3></div>
    
          <p>
            My 2 minutes of mindfulness occurred around the time of pair-programming. I found 
            the practice lead to better productiveness both physically &amp; emotionally.

      <h3 class = "para-header">Pair Programming &amp; Emotional Intelligence Skills</h3></div>
          
          <p>
            This was the first time I had experienced working with a fellow developer on-line. Having never met each other in person there was initial trepidation but I quickly put that aside. I imagined that my pair colleague also had this feeling &amp; was able to let trepidation go. My main feeling was not really about getting the code right or working but really one of - not wanting to let my pair colleague down. I do not believe this is a bad or negative feeling but rather an incentive feeling to respond to what was required. I enjoyed the experience &amp; felt I pulled on my emotional intelligence skills when needed in a positive manner &amp; with the right attitude.
