            While rebuilding and redesigning this site I was more concerned with making one or two changes or modifications at a time, committing and pushing to Github then checking with the browser dev tools and in other browsers. I have then rejected or accepted the changes - for now. I am really trying to understand the skeleton and normalize css files and how I need to code my custom css file. Initially I thought the twelve column structure to be something else where as in fact it is quite different and a little more complex. For example when I allotted three columns to the left division, I found that it was not 25% of the body but 25% of that division. But I may be wrong. So my understanding is not quite clear at present. Not overly concerned with the way it looks visually but in saying that I do have a vision in my head how I would like it to be eventually but accept that learning and understanding the processes to reach that end product are more important. If the end product is different to what I visualize that is fine with me.

            I have always admired people that practice meditation. Maybe it is the spiritual, cultural and exotic appeal. Never really thought that I could meditate.

             That anyone can meditate any where and any time. Two minutes is more than enough. Learned not to be too self-deprecating.

            I like the suggestion to think of one's self as a mountain while meditating - too pull the force and focus inward. Choice of posture also reverberated with me.

            One musing I have is the word or idea of 'happiness'. I believe it is hard to quantify, meaning different things to different people. Has 'happiness' been over-used and manipulated then bottled and packaged by some for commercial gain?
