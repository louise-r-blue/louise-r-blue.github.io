      <h3 class = "para-header">Scope</h3></div>
  
          <p>
            Javascript has function scope &amp; global scope. If you were following instructions from two kit-sets to construct a shelf &amp; coffee table &amp; the instructions clearly labeled the utility screws &amp; where they were to go you would have no problem. Errors or mistakes would occur if you were to take a coffee table screw ( unbeknown to you, of quite a different size, capability &amp; unlabeled ) &amp; affix this screw in to the shelving unit - well it is not going to work. Unless this particular screw is of universal use which in javascript means globally accessible by any other code that wants to use it - then by all means a universal screw is perfect for the job but it would have to be a very special screw. The distinctly labeled screw is the to javascript the function scope &amp; can only be used with the coffee table or shelf - not both.
          </p>

    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Parentheses ()</h3></div>
    
          <p>
            If the build coffee table instructions above where defined in a javascript function it would begin with something like this - <code>function buildTable()...</code>. The () must match &amp; can or can not have parameters. In this example we could have three - like <code>function buildTable(item, x,number)...</code>. The item, x &amp; number are inputs that the following block of code will work with &amp; execute. If you then want to use the function you call it like this  - <code>buildTable(screw, 30,20)...</code>. The screw is the item, 30 is screw locations &amp; the 20 is the number of screws. These are arguments that the code manipulates &amp; executes on.
          </p>
              
      <div class = "blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Brackets [ ]</h3></div>
          
          <p>
            Mis-matched brackets in javascript causes errors. If your kit set instructions missed a valuable word or finalizing step -could be your coffee table becomes a boggy board. On your completed shelf(?) you have a collection of valuable &amp; rare books divided into categories with shelf partitions. One partition does not appear to be in its right location or there at all - your valuable &amp; rare books take a tumble.
          </p>
         
      <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Braces { }</h3></div>
  
          <p>
             Following the <code>buildTable(item, x, number)...</code> we add { }. Inside these braces is the instruction block which acts on the item, x, number &amp; any other declared variables in the function. Errors are made when there are not matching opening &amp; closing braces. For this example could be something like this - <code> { if ( number === x ) do something ...}</code>.
          </p>

      <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Single Quotes ' ' &amp; Double Quotes " "</h3></div>
  
          <p>
             Javascript excepts both single &amp; double quotes when declaring or outputting a string value - which is seen as text &amp; based on how you want the text to be treated &amp; behave. Any character between the quotes whether it is a numeral, letter &amp; so on is treated as text. Consistency requires using either ' ' or " " throughout the code. However if you wanted to claim emphasis on a word/s in an output message from your function <code>{...var message = "Coffee table completed 'Hurray!' "; .... }</code> - you just make sure to use the alternative quote style so Javascript does not get confused.
