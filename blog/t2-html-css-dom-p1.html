    <p>Have you ever received or given a present - lets say a plain cardboard box with a simple message saying 'To you, please open'. Opening the box you find another plain cardboard box with another message. Open that one and you find two cardboard boxes and so it goes on. This is a lot like html -a markup language for web pages, which forms the basic structure of a web page. We need that plain cardboard box.</p>

    <p>Your friend or you feel a bit embarrased about the cardboard box and descide/s to get some help with css (cascading style sheets), with the emphasis on style. You or they receive a colourfully wrapped box with pretty labels, bows and ribbons. Tearing the paper of you/they find three more colourfully wrapped boxes with beautiful labels with writing and other goodies attached. The paper is heavily embossed with gold flecks. On opening one of the boxes you find many boxed compartments. One label suggests you go to another box and open it. This goes on and on. How can so many boxes fit in one. That is the wizardry of the DOM - which is the document objct model. The DOM is like the father of all trees. Its many branches have many boxes hanging. It has not stopped growing.</p>

    <p>Everything on a web page is in a box whether it is text, imagery, photography, iconograpghy, video and so on. A Udacity developer described their processes and techniques for designing a web page. Using a visual board with a grid, cut out all the boxes you can see on the paper web site template. These are then placed on the visual board, and can be moved easily about. A Udacity front end developer described his method of design. Using a pencil he simply sketched out the boxes he sees. It helps better to visualize the design this way so you are not going in blindly. It is almost like you are reversing the design process, infact many designers of different disciplines work this way. One of Udacity's messages is 'break it down'.</p>

    <p>The 'box model' is fundamental to designing web pages with CSS. Rectangular boxes with defined content, locations, padding, borders and margins and other styling features govern the design of web pages. Starting in the centre is the content which is generally what the viewer or user sees. Moving outward is the padding, then border and finally margin. Some of these boxes will not be visible to the user. The box model is treated as one unit and can be manipulated and engineered to fantastic effect. For example a box can be rotated, skewed, flipped and so on. There is order and standards to the box model. By correctly defining tags, elements, classs and style sheets etc; you can still be adventurous within the confines of the 'box model'</p>
