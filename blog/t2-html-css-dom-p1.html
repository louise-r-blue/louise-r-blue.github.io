    <p>Have you ever received or given a present - lets say a plain cardboard box with a simple message saying 'To you, please open'. Opening the box you find another plain cardboard box with another message. Open that one and you find two cardboard boxes and so it goes on. This is a lot like html -a markup language for web pages, which forms the basic structure of a web page. We need that plain cardboard box.</p>

    <p>Your friend or you feel a bit embarrased about the cardboard box and descide to get some help with css (cascading style sheets), with the emphasis on style. You or they receive a colourfully wrapped box with pretty labels, bows and ribbons. Tearing the paper of you/they find three more colourfully wrapped boxes with beautiful labels with writing and other goodies attached. The paper is heavily embossed with gold flecks.</p></div>
