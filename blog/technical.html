        <h2 class="section-heading"><abbr title ="Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets and the Object Document Model">HTML,&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;DOM</abbr></h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever received or given a present - lets say a plain cardboard box with a simple message saying 'To you, please open'. Opening the box you find another plain cardboard box with another message. Open that one &amp; you find two cardboard boxes &amp; so it goes on. This is a lot like html -a markup language for web pages, which forms the basic structure of a web page. We need that plain cardboard box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your friend or you feel a bit embarrassed about the cardboard box &amp; decide/s to get some help with css (cascading style sheets), with the emphasis on style. You or they receive a colorfully wrapped box with pretty labels, bows &amp; ribbons. Tearing the paper of you/they find three more colorfully wrapped boxes with beautiful labels with writing &amp; other goodies attached. The paper is heavily embossed with gold flecks. On opening one of the boxes you find many boxed compartments. One label suggests you go to another box &amp; open it. This goes on &amp; on. How can so many boxes fit in one. That is the wizardry of the DOM - which is the document object model. The DOM is like the mother of all trees. Its many branches have many boxes hanging. It has not stopped growing.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Boxifying design</h2>
        <p>
          Everything on a web page is in a box whether it is text, imagery, photography, iconography, video &amp; so on. A Udacity developer described their processes &amp; techniques for designing a web page. Using a visual board with a grid, cut out all the boxes you can see on the paper web site template. These are then placed on the visual board, &amp; can be moved easily about. A Udacity front end developer described his method of design. Using a pencil he simply sketched out the boxes he sees. It helps better to visualize the design this way so you are not going in blindly. It is almost like you are reversing the design process, in fact many designers of different disciplines work this way. One of Udacity's messages is 'break it down'.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Box model</h2>
        <p>
          The 'box model' is fundamental to designing web pages with CSS. Rectangular boxes with defined content, locations, padding, borders &amp; margins &amp; other styling features govern the design of web pages. Starting in the center is the content which is generally what the viewer or user sees. Moving outward is the padding, then border &amp; finally margin. Some of these boxes will not be visible to the user. The box model is treated as one unit &amp; can be manipulated &amp; engineered to fantastic effect. For example a box can be rotated, skewed, flipped &amp; so on. There is order &amp; standards to the box model. By correctly defining tags, elements, classes &amp; style sheets etc; you can still be adventurous within the confines of the 'box model'.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Responsive</h2>
        <p>
          A responsive site is one which adjusts and scales appropriately to the users choice of device and screen resolution. The device could be a smart-phone, tablet or desktop and screen resolutions range from 360px x 598px, 600px x 960px to 1280px x 1024px respectively.
          The 'px' is a pixel - like a cube and is pixels per screen inch. A responsive site uses one set of code to service all the users devices and screen resolutions. A site must also take in to consideration the users viewing environment - such as indoor and  outdoor conditions, slow and fast connection speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsive sites are becoming increasingly important as users are accessing a varied and growing range of devices. One of the challenges for a responsive site is with mobiles and touch screens. Users use fingers as navigational tools on a mobile - choice of button size and position becomes paramount.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Functions</h2>
        <p>
           Functions group a set of operations with a given name that other code can call on or invoke to perform. They are useful because you may want to perform an operation more than once. They perform actions and methods on data like the objects mentioned above. Functions group logic and encourage code reuse. Less code and less duplicate code is written.
