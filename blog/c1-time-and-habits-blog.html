    <p>The Timebox technique I have tried is my version of the Pondoro. Have a spare cell phone that I use specifically for timing/nothing else. Do find I will work over time. I feel it is important to me to finish a task otherwise it can play on my mind. So I will need to employ some self-discipline and not be too precious about the work.</p>

    <p>I had been prascticing some cognitive techniques on and off that related to breathing but after reading the articles about meditation realize that I need to set aside a definite portion of time a couple of times a week to do this and make it worthwhile.</p>

    <p>In the artical - 'Counter-intuitive Productivity' I found Tip #6 'Give yourself less time particualry interesting. You have to question really why is an 8hr day 40hr working week so universally accepted, Why not a 3 day working week, 1 day job share, have a great 3 day weekend....</p>

    <p>Breathing, visualising and focusing on where and how my breathe is travelling through me works for me. Helps center me in the present and calms me down</p>

    <p>I would continue with the breathing and try some other meditative techniques. Also would to try some tricks for getting into the zone at night before bedtime. So far I do the breathing exercises and go over what wwent well for me during the day and visualise what will go well for me tomorrow.</p>
