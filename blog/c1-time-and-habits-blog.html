      <h3 class = "para-header">Timebox &amp; habits I tried</h3></div>

        
          <p>
            The timebox technique I have tried is a version of the Pomodoro. I use an old cell phone for timing. Do find I will work over time to finish a task. I will try to employ some self-discipline and not be too precious about uncompleted work.I had been practicing some cognitive techniques on and off that related to breathing but after reading the articles about meditation realize that I need to set aside a definite portion of time, for the technique to be effective.
          </p>
        
    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">What I Found Interesting</h3></div>
        
          <p>
            In the articale - 'Counter-intuitive Productivity' I found Tip #6 'Give yourself less time' particularly interesting. I think we have been hard-wired into thinking an 8hr day, 40hr working week is acceptable. Maybe less is more.
          </p>
       
    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">What Worked For Me</h3></div>    
       
          <p>
            Breathing, visualizing and focusing on where and how my breathe is traveling through me, works for me. Helps center me in the present and calms me down.
          </p>
  
    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">What I Will Experiment With</h3></div>    
  
          <p class = "experiment">
            I would continue with the breathing and try some other meditative techniques. Also would to try some tricks for getting into the zone at night. So far I do the breathing exercises and go over what went well for me during the day and visualize what will go well for me tomorrow.
