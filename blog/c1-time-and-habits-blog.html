    <p>The Timebox technique I have tried is my version of the Pomodoro. I use an old cell phone for timing. Do find I will work over time. I feel it is important to me to finish a task otherwise it can niggle me and play on my mind. So I will need to employ some self-discipline and not be too precious about uncompleted work.</p>

    <p>I had been practicing some cognitive techniques on and off that related to breathing but after reading the articles about meditation realize that I need to set aside a definite portion of time a couple of times a week to do this efficiently and make it worthwhile.</p>

    <p>In the artical - 'Counter-intuitive Productivity' I found Tip #6 'Give yourself less time' particualry interesting. You have to question really why an 8hr day 40hr working week is so universally accepted. Why not a 2 day working week, 1 day job share, 1 day voluntary and have a great 3 day weekend....</p>

    <p>Breathing, visualising and focusing on where and how my breathe is travelling through me, works for me. Helps center me in the present and calms me down</p>

    <p>I would continue with the breathing and try some other meditative techniques. Also would to try some tricks for getting into the zone at night before bedtime. So far I do the breathing exercises and go over what went well for me during the day and visualise what will go well for me tomorrow.</p>
