    <h2>Timebox and habits I tried</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>The timebox technique I have tried is a version of the Pomodoro. I use an old cell phone for timing. Do find I will work over time to finish a task. I will try to employ some self-discipline and not be too precious about uncompleted work.
      I had been practicing some cognitive techniques on and off that related to breathing but after reading the articles about meditation realize that I need to set aside a definite portion of time, for the technique to be effective.</p>

    <h2>What I found interesting</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>In the artical - 'Counter-intuitive Productivity' I found Tip #6 'Give yourself less time' particualry interesting. I think we have been hard-wired into thinking an 8hr day, 40hr working week is acceptable. Maybe less is more.</p>

    <h2>What worked for me</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Breathing, visualising and focusing on where and how my breathe is travelling through me, works for me. Helps center me in the present and calms me down.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
    <h2>What I will experiment with</h2>
    </div>

      <div>
      <p>I would continue with the breathing and try some other meditative techniques. Also would to try some tricks for getting into the zone at night. So far I do the breathing exercises and go over what went well for me during the day and visualise what will go well for me tomorrow.</p>
