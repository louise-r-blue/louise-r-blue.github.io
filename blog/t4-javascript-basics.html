          <p>
            HtML is the foundation to web pages - and is the static layout of text. To style this text we use CSS - cascading style sheets which adds color, images, decorative font and border styles and so on.
            Then in comes Javascript which is a dynamic scripting language which lets us the developers create interactive web pages. When a web page loads javascript can manipulate and change and the HTML elements and objects, css properties and style that you see in those pages - such as buttons and text input fields, color - the list is endless.

          <p>
            We all make decisions based on conditions and comparisons in every day life such as preparing and kneading a good pizza dough. Lets assume you have all the ingredients at hand.
          </p>
              <ul>

                  <li> You ask yourself - if it is a good time of day to make pizza dough? You must consider the temperature &#38 humidity of the room.</li>
                  <li>You use a thermometer to calculate the temperature. About 25&deg C is ideal. You can proceed at this point.</li>
                  <li>If not ideal conditions you warm utensils and flour above warm oven.</li>
                  <li>You prepare by measuring ingredients to desired weights. Put aside excess flour</li>
                  <li>Then you allow the yeast to activate in your measured tepid water - timing  five minutes</li>
                  <li>&#190 of the sifted flour first goes in to a bowl. Reserve &#188 for later</li>
                  <li>You make a well in the center of the flour &#38 add the measured yeast, cold water, oil &#38 salt</li>
                  <li>Then you slowly combine the flour in, stirring from center outward</li>
                  <li>If you have a thick batter you turn out to a floured surface</li>
                  <li>If not, you add a little more flour &#38 mix</li>
                  <li>You then set a timer to 8 minutes</li>
                  <li>Then you knead quickly - gradually adding the &#188 flour you reserved earlier</li>
                  <li>Timer goes off</li>
                  <li>You decide if dough is at required consistency - not sticky</li>
                  <li>If too sticky you set timer for another 2 minutes &#38 knead</li>
                  <li>If ok roll dough in to a tight ball</li>
                  <li>Cover &#38 leave dough to rest</li>
                  <li>Done</li>

              </ul>

      <h3 class = "data-access">Accessing Data Differently</h3></div>
          
          <p>
            Both arrays and object literals are containers that store or hold collections of data but are accessed in different ways. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            Accessing data from an array requires you to point at an item by way of an index. Each item has a unique index number. Much like a cataloged book on a shelf.
          </p>
       
          <p>
            Accessing data from object literals requires you to point at named keys for the values. The object
            literals are like boxes in a boxed compartment - like a P.O post office box where individuals can access mail with a unique key.
          <p>

      <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "functy">Functions</h3></div>
  
          <p>
             Functions group a set of operations with a given name that other code can call on or invoke to perform. They are useful because you may want to perform an operation more than once. They perform actions and methods on data like the objects mentioned above. Functions group logic and encourage code reuse. Less code and less duplicate code is written.
