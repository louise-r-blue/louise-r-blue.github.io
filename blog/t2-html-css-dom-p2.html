    <p>The grid system consists of columns and rows. According to Udacity most web site grid systems today have 12 columns. This is divisible by 3 making for an even layout across the page. A viewer's eyes first travel across the top of the page and down in a left to right process. The grid structure also works left to right starting at the upper left of a web page. The grid structure of a layout is controlled by css. For example you have a web page which has 2 clear sections, 3 columns make up the section on the left and 9 columns- the remainder of 12 columns, make up the section on the right. Using percentages allows for this grid pattern to be utilised on any device. Now for a little math.</p>

        <ul>
          
          <li>3 columns = 25% (of the page width) which is 3/12 x 100</li>
          <li>9 columns = 75% (of the page width) which is 9/12 x 100</li>

        </ul>

    <p>Of course take 25 way from 100 and you have 75 but it is good to do the simple math. The maximum width common today is 960px so 3 columns work out to be 240px in width and 9 columns would be the remainder - 720px.
    One css property and value is 'display-flex;flex-wrap:wrap;'. This will allow columns to align next to each other, if their width is defined.</p>
