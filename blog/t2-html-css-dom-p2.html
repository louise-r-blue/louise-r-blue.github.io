    <p>The grid system consists of columns and rows. According to Udacity most web site grid systems today have 12 columns. This is divisible by 3 making for an even layout across the page. A viewer's eyes first travel across the top of the page and down in a left to right process. The grid structure also works left to right starting at the upper left of a web page. The grid structure of a layout is controlled by css. For example you have a web page which has 2 clear sections, 3 columns make up the section on the left and 9 columns- the remainder of 12 columns, make up the section on the right. Using percentages allows for this grid pattern to be utilised on any device. Now for a little math.</p>

        <ul>
          
          <li>3 columns = 25% which is 3/12 x 100</li>
          <li>9 columns = 75% which is 9/12 x 100</li>

        </ul>

    <p>Of course take 25 way from 100 and you have 75 but it is good to do the simple math. The maximum width common today is 960px so 3 columns (%25) work out to be 240px in width and 9 columns (%75)would be the remainder - 720px.
    One css property and value is 'display-flex;flex-wrap:wrap;'. This will allow columns to align next to each other, if their width is defined.</p>

    <p>Websites must respond to user's demands. As more and more devices are used to access websites - these sites must look great no matter what device, browser or resolution. The developer must work toward creating websites that cater for many users needs.</p>

    <p>Udacity pointed to the 'gizmodo' website as an example of good responsive design. The site uses Media Queries in css properties, depending on device, screen size and colour. Another resource Udacity suggested was on gitHub called 'normalize.css'. Helps ensure your css style will be interpreted the same across all browsers.</p>

    <p>Any problems a developer may have are sure to be resolved by asking questions on such sites as 'stackoverflow'.</p>

    <p>I visulize semantic structure has having a beginning, middle and end, much like any good story or film. Of course there is much more to it than that simple statement. Semantic structure consists of semantic elements that organize and describe content on a web page. All elements must have a starting tag and almost all must have a closing tag. THe element name is enclosed in opening tags < > and in closing tags </ >. Must have elements are 
    !DOCTYPE html, html(hyper text markup language), head, and body. The !DOCTYPE html is the document  declaration telling browsers that it is a html page. The html element wraps the entire page in html. The head element holds links to external resources, the title of the page and meta data which is used by search machines and is not displayed in the browser. The body element holds all the content displayed in the browser and is visible to the user. Elements in the body include but not limited to include - headingss, paragraphs, divisions and aside. These elements can be matched with class styles which can be used more than once on a page or ID styles that can only be used once on a page. These help form the semantic structure of a web page design.
