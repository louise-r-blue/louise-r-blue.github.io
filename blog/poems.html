            I didn’t come to fool you<br>
            you were there without your wits<br>
            I had to put a price on it<br>
            then<br>
            you deemed yourself unfit<br>
            in ten minutes you said 3 months<br>
            its never going to be enough<br>
            I am now here to fool you and call your bluff<br>
            you choose not to listen nor read<br>
            so I took the truth away<br>
            you don’t have one wit to lead<br>
            as you signed the end of my delay<br>
            with your mumbling something and nothing<br>
            I started not to care<br>
            but I'm still feeling angry<br>
            when you rush to your lair<br>
            I guess your off then<br>
            to find your missing wit<br>
            the moral of the lesson though was to not be such a big twit<br><br>

            arriving together without a backbone between them<br>  
            mr devils advocate, mr fudge and mr poker face<br>
            micro facilitator translator transcriber judge jury attack-dog and note-taker but not mediator<br>
            then a Diva deceiver don’t believe her took up the lead<br>
            with<br>
            surround sound their impacts were read<br>
            but as I had practiced<br>
            telling them I was sorry<br>        
            practicing and practicing<br>
            just to pretend<br>
            not to be heard<br>
            had to be careful with what I said<br>
            as<br>
            Diva deceiver don’t believe her opened her mouth<br>
            I interrupted<br>
            asking note-taker I wasn't aware of a law for this kind of stuff<br>
            then thinking and feeling so mean<br>
            I wanted to take a pin<br>
            and prick the fat bloated queen.<br>
            leaving rather quickly still no backbone between them<br>
            headfirst they went squeezing in the shaft in a flurry<br>
            as for lies dont worry<br>
            and for truth its too late<br>
            words are words and just lame<br><br>

            I didn’t mean to say sorry,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry<br>
            I only came to pretend<br>
            I only came because I had to<br>
            and to play your game.<br<br>

            The bully is a virus<br>
            creeping up on you<br>
            attacking from behind<br>
            an insidious and monstrous disease<br>
            poisonous and malicious<br>
            no one dares care or believes<br>
            its bitterness is vicious<br>
            so be cautious<br>
            and make wishes<br>
            better be careful while I work<br>
            better be careful of the bark<br>
            better mind my back<br>
            better shut-up keep myself still and keep my mind sharp<br><br>

            its like stepping in dog shit with every step you take<br>
            its feeling like it should be home time when your sad tired and withdrawn<br>
            then you realize its only just gone dawn<br>
            its like being in a race but your going the wrong way<br>
            it feels like a bad dream<br>
            and your stuck in a play<br>
            its only act one scene number two<br>
            when two old muppets say<br>
            its terrible<br>
            its rubbish<br>
            Booooooooooo<br><br>

            If the bully had half a brain<br>
            it would be dangerous<br>
            make no mistake<br>
            if you took that pin and pricked<br>
            it would heave and breath flatulence<br>
            it will summon its minions its toys and demons<br>
            it will attack you<br>
            hurling insults smirking belching and farting<br>
            no i'm not joking<br>
            take courage and the knowledge<br>
            if that’s how they behave<br>
            that your doing the right thing and your ok<br>
            put up a fight<br>
            its better to be brave<br>
            your going to live<br>
            your going to breath<br>
            your human<br>
            you will see another day<br><br>
