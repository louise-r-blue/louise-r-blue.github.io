            I am now here to fool you and call your bluff<br>
            you choose not to listen nor to read<br>

            I guess your off then<br>

            telling them I was sorry<br>        
            practicing and practicing<br>
            just to pretend<br>

            The bully is a virus<br>
            creeping up behind you<br>
            insidious
            deceptive
            poisonous, malicious and seeping in unkindness<br>
            it feeds on your insecurities.<br>
            The virus chooses a new costume everday and Fridays<br>
            to enthrall themselves and all who attend<br>
            you think to yourself<br>
            is this it<br>
            you hesitate<br>
            you cant think<br>
            your like on the brink<br>
            you dont want do what your told<br>
            your suspicious and clever<br>
            you want to live forever<br>
            but the bully<br>
            is now chucky, dressed like a five year old<br><br>

            better be careful while I work<br>
            better be careful of the bark<br>
            better mind my back<br>
            better shut-up keep myself still and keep my mind sharp<br><br>

            its like stepping in dog shit with every step you take<br>
            its feeling like it should be home time your tired and withdrawn<br>
            then you realize its just gone dawn<br>
            its like running a race but your going the wrong way<br>
            and you then realize you are the only one made to pay<br>
            it feels like a bad dream<br>
            you want to scream but nothing comes out<br>
            and your stuck in a play<br>
            its only act one scene number two<br>
            when two old muppets say<br>
            it was terrible<br>
            it was rubbish<br>
            Booooooooooooooooo<br><br>

            If the bully had half a brain<br>
            it would be dangerous<br>
            no mistake<br>
            if you took that pin and pricked<br>
            it would burst flatulence<br>
            it will summon its minions its toys and demons<br>
            it will attack you<br>
            hurling insults smirking belching farting and poking<br>
            no i'm not joking<br>
            take courage and the knowledge<br>
            if that’s how they behave<br>
            that your doing the right thing and your ok<br>
            put up a fight<br>
            its better to be brave<br>
            your going to live<br>
            your going to breath<br>
            your human<br>
            and you will live to see another day<br><br>

            <h3>Act 1 scene 1 - Its there before you get there</h3>
          <p>
            On day one<br>
            I see you’ve defaced my cv<br>
            I don’t say a word<br>
            but<br>
            still your keen to tell to me shut-up<br>
            as you talk<br>
            value in opinion is important<br>
            whether 1 day 5 year of service here.<br>
            Still I have said little 
            when<br>
            sly-man goes by with a twittle.<br>
            'Why don’t you go and do the dishes’<br>
            ‘Your not being resourced on anything’<br>
            ‘Go solve it yourself because we don’t know’<br>
            ‘Do you have any friends here’<br>
            ‘Well pick it up we’re not moving’<br>
            'Well I hope youv'e washed it, your old skirt'<br>
            ‘You don’t have any allies here do you do you do you’<br>
            ‘I can’t be seen with you’<br>
            Stickies with ‘who’s-your-best-friend’<br>
            I still say little.<br>
            I see in the monitor though<br>
            puffy white faces pulling and poking at<br>
            me as I turned<br>
            2 seniors creep<br>
            excuses and lies fly<br>                             
            I say a little<br>
            monitor reflection doesn't lie<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Act 1 scene 2 - Culturally Anaemic</h3>

          <p>
            In team circles<br>
            you humiliate<br>
            intimidate<br>
            derogate<br>
            expanding<br>
            your pitch for a years resolution is to be a bitch<br>
            not hard for<br>
            liar liar britches<br>
            on fire.<br>
            Your women’s meeting is a sham<br>
            a ridicule<br>
            to blame another man.<br>
            Atrocities down south<br>
            you’re proud to claim<br>
            you don’t care about what<br>

            down there<br>
            you’re are not from here<br>

          <h3>Act 2 Scene 1 - Precious</h3>
          
          <p>
            You have plentiful words like<br>
            pineapple, llama and dinosaur stickers<br>
            for person of the day<br>
            fantasy figurines, costumes and colouring-in<br>
            precious<br>
            to<br>
            reward<br>
            stifle conversation, demolish and prove others worthless.<br>
            You have celebratory cakes with a machiavellian twist<br>
            icy toppings and bitter undertones<br>
            glasses of what-is-your-poison<br>
            with a generous dash of nepotism from the fizzy wine under you desk<br>
            lashings of unsavoury liaison<br>
            to the man clutching matching tattoos<br>
            tightly coupled with hr<br>
            precious.<br>
            Bizzare.<br>
            Claiming you have a natural roving eye and loud vocal abilities<br>
            I still hear you eyes and see you whisper<br>
            your<br>
            precious capabilities.<br>
            You desire<br>
            to shackle folk down to diminish their luck<br>
            derogative remarks for potential employees and interviewees<br>
            suck.<br>
            Muting<br>
            And back-stabbing colleagues makes your day<br>
            contempt is a hammer for those who in your way<br>
            Then choosing a good dash of<br>
            grooming<br>
            monitoring<br>
            those it will let stay.<br><br>

            a foul wind drops by<br>
            and you shove me in the back<br>
            knocking me down<br>
            heaving a door in my face<br>
            I thought so hard<br>
            only<br>
            to loose face.<br>
            creepy texts<br>
            why wont I talk to you<br>
            still I say little,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet.<br>
            Your hollering at me<br>
            I holler back<br>
            you run to it<br>
            I get caught in a<br>
            trap<br>
            it has mana and seniority<br>
            over me<br>
            but I don’t feel see sense mana<br>

              So I make a quick decision<br>
              before its to late<br>
              I get up<br>
              while your heads still in the tv<br>
              quick<br>
              I’m out the door<br>
              before you know I have even gone<br>
              I swear.<br>
              This is it<br>
              going back is just wrong<br><br>

              you didn’t can’t won’t think<br>
              what are the chances of this happening.<br><br>

            <h3>Part 1.  Deep Dive</h3>
            <p>
            26 have gone including me<br><br>

            I’m exiled and isolated<br>
            a quiet relief<br>
            It gives me<br>
            time to peruse<br>
            be home undercover<br>
            checking your rules or is it a ruse<br><br>

            The clean-up<br>
            is underway<br>
            sweeping swathes of documents out of the way<br>
            details are ignored, destroyed and manipulated.<br>
            Its covering up its tracks<br>
            wiping the slate clean<br>
            deleting records and tirades of messages that match<br>
            permissions changed<br>
            new rules made after the fact.<br>
            You think I’m daft<br>
            but I have a good memory<br>
            copies, notes and recordings<br>
            of<br>
            private and confidential info that you slacked<br>
            of me<br>
            for a discord.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Part 2. Pluck</h3>

            <p>
              You write about diversity for all fellows<br>
              but those words aren’t even yours<br>
              you’ve plucked and cherry-picked someones else’s values<br>
              misused<br>
              misguided<br>
              misinformed<br>
              misinterpreted<br>
              shape unshifting a culture<br>
              adorning bad behaviour<br>
              powering those<br>
              care plans<br>
              collateral<br>
              to<br>
              give yourself favour.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Part 3. Hocus Pocus</h3>

            <p>
              Your congratulating yourselves<br>
              for<br>
              fast tracking immigration<br>
              they are  better passing through<br>
              adorning yourselves with promotions<br>
              and<br>
              back-tracking<br>
              accolades for seeing it through<br>
              to keep<br>
              you agreeable<br>
              you happy<br>
              oh<br>
              what fun it must have been<br>
              for you.<br><br>
            
              Is it that you have too much time 
              and not much to do
              or
              is it that your jealous of them not like you<br>
              I won the first reward for being bothered<br>
              and saving a client some grief.<br>
              or was it when I’m flying along with the story reviews<br>
              the client knows it you know it but don’t like it<br>
              I take time off<br>
              your<br>
              story points drop<br>
              and the client knows it.<br>
              If it isn’t enough<br>
              you overcharge and deceive the man<br>
              does he know it. Probably.<br>
              Gossiping is<br>
              unhealthy don’t you know it can make you green<br>
              with<br>
              your constant reviews and your magic pen<br>
              nagging<br>
              dragging me down<br>
              down the rabbit hole.<br>
              Down<br>
              down<br>
              down.<br>

            Orchestrating its moves<br>
            the wasp gathers momentum<br>
            it can’t dance like a bee<br>
            nor jump like a flea<br>
            it can’t glide like a monarch<br>
            or tread softly like me<br>

            If there was a law for playing the<br>
            game of work<br>
            fairly<br>
            <br>

              If you bully, intimidate or harass you forfeit {n} turns<br>

              singing ‘the woolly mammoth is dead’<br>

              gossiping, spreading rumours or back-stabbing<br>

              over and over again<br>
              for more than {n} day<br>

              stand on a box reciting “Who ate all the cake. I did”<br>
