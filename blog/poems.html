            I am now here to fool you and call your bluff<br>
            you choose not to listen nor to read<br>

            I guess your off then<br>

            but as I had practiced<br>
            telling them I was sorry<br>        
            practicing and practicing<br>
            just to pretend<br>
            not to be heard<br>
            had to be careful with what I said<br>

            The bully is a virus<br>
            creeping up behind you<br>
            insidious
            deceptive
            poisonous, malicious and seeping in unkindness<br>
            it feeds on your insecurities.<br>
            the virus chooses a new costume everday and Fridays<br>
            to enthrall themselves and all who attend<br>
            you think to yourself<br>
            is this it<br>
            you hesitate<br>
            you cant think<br>
            your like on the brink<br>
            you dont want do what your told<br>
            your suspicious and clever<br>
            you want to live forever<br>
            but the bully<br>
            is now chucky, dressed like a five year old<br><br>

            better be careful while I work<br>
            better be careful of the bark<br>
            better mind my back<br>
            better shut-up keep myself still and keep my mind sharp<br><br>

            its like stepping in dog shit with every step you take<br>
            its feeling like it should be home time your tired and withdrawn<br>
            then you realize its just gone dawn<br>
            its like running a race but your going the wrong way<br>
            and you then realize you are the only one made to pay<br>
            it feels like a bad dream<br>
            you want to scream but nothing comes out<br>
            and your stuck in a play<br>
            its only act one scene number two<br>
            when two old muppets say<br>
            its terrible<br>
            its rubbish<br>
            Booooooooooooooooo<br><br>

            If the bully had half a brain<br>
            it would be dangerous<br>
            no mistake<br>
            if you took that pin and pricked<br>
            it would burst flatulence<br>
            it will summon its minions its toys and demons<br>
            it will attack you<br>
            hurling insults smirking belching farting and poking<br>
            no i'm not joking<br>
            take courage and the knowledge<br>
            if that’s how they behave<br>
            that your doing the right thing and your ok<br>
            put up a fight<br>
            its better to be brave<br>
            your going to live<br>
            your going to breath<br>
            your human<br>
            and you will live to see another day<br><br>

          <p>
            On day one<br>
            I see you’ve defaced my cv<br>
            I don’t say a word<br>
            but<br>
            still your keen to tell to me shut-up<br>
            as you talk<br>
            value in opinion is important<br>
            whether 1 day 5 year of service here.<br>
            Still I have said little 
            when<br>
            sly-man goes by with a twittle.<br>
            'Why don’t you go and do the dishes’<br>
            ‘Your not being resourced on anything’<br>
            ‘Go solve it yourself because we don’t know’<br>
            ‘Do you have any friends here’<br>
            ‘Well pick it up we’re not moving’<br>
            ‘You don’t have any allies here do you do you do you’<br>
            ‘I can’t be seen with you’<br>
            Stickies with ‘who’s-your-best-friend’<br>
            I still say little.<br>
            I see in the monitor though<br>
            puffy white faces pulling and poking at<br>
            me as I turned<br>
            2 seniors creep<br>
            excuses and lies fly<br>                             
            I say a little<br>
            monitor reflection doesn't lie<br><br>

          <h3>Act 1 scene 2 Culturally Anaemic</h3>

          <p>
            In team circles<br>
            you humiliate<br>
            intimidate<br>
            derogate<br>
            expanding<br>
            your pitch for a years resolution is to be a bitch<br>
            not hard for<br>
            liar liar britches<br>
            on fire.<br>
            Your women’s meeting is a sham<br>
            a ridicule<br>
            to blame another man.<br>
            Atrocities down south<br>
            you’re proud to claim<br>
            you don’t care about what<br>

              Your being set up to fail you have been heard.<br>
              Well she has had all the chances.<br>
              as you beckon me in<br>
              to unwittingly participate<br>
              for an informal what-is-it day<br>
              to which I asked for in self review.<br>
              But its a calculated manipulation<br>
              a sabotage a cover<br>
              I just don’t know<br>
              yet.<br>
              One head is in a telly and note-taker is the voice over.<br><br>

              You fill me in with the crude plan<br>
              telling me<br>
              Im not quite human<br>
              can’t communicate<br>
              you look me up and down<br>
              say I don’t look right<br>
              I shouldn’t speak or think<br>
              shut up<br>
              we don’t care<br>
              we are not listening<br><br>

              Your now ask me<br>
              to sign seal and<br>
              deliver<br>
              on rules and policies not yet written.<br>
              Details are sketchy<br>
              morality seriously lacking<br>
              note-takers still mocking<br>
              my heart is racing.<br>
              So I make a quick decision<br>
              before its to late<br>
              I get up<br>
              while your heads still smirking in the tv<br>
              quick<br>
              I’m out the door<br>
              before you know I have even gone<br>
              I swear.<br>
              This is it<br>
              going back is just wrong.<br><br>

              you didn’t can’t won’t think<br>
              what are the chances of this happening.<br><br>
