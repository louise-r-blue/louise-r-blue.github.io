          <p>
            One step forward - two steps back would be my experience with the racer game. I envisaged introducing another player but as an obstacle to the race &amp; has no key control. The obstacle's course is on the Y axis starting at a negative position &amp; terminates at the canvas height maximum, where it's course starts all over again at the negative position. It is like a continuous loop I would like to control. Currently the only control over the obstacle is positioning it further back on the negative Y axis. The idea is to create a collision function that when either player collides with the obstacle that player is forced out of the race. For what ever reason, in writing the code for the obstacle I have disrupted the winners message - so that requires some attention. As an end note would like to mention any styling is of no consequence at the moment.

          <p>
            One thing I have learned is that I do not understand the DOM as much as I would like. I have spent some time researching methods &amp; techniques for accessing HTML elements through Javascript even before I have thought about any calculation functions or operations &amp; looked at plenty of code on-line &amp; much more. I also know I would like to get better at reading other peoples code. Have decided to go with JQuery in the hope ( yes hope ) that I make up for not uderstanding it so well in the previous Resume challenge, albeit the codes not going to be pretty but it will calculate.
