      <h3 class = "para-header">My EDA Experience</h3></div>
        
          <p>
            My take is that I am so grateful to have brilliant hard working coaches like Shereef, who believe in us and who will guide us on our journey. The founders and coaches have identified a real need, developing a unique learning opportunity for those who dare! 
          </p>
         
      
   <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">My Impressions</h3></div>
          <p>
            My impression right now is - I am thinking this is actually happening, I am really here working with a fabulous team of people. I tell myself to open my eyes and ears. Impressed into me now is Shereef's comments re 'working socially'. I took from that web developing or coding is a people business. We need to interact with colleagues, team members, coaches, clients and users where-ever they be. To make the code real, meaningful and be mindful of others.
          </p>
        
    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">How Will I Engage?</h3></div>
          <p>
            I am going to engage in this culture by being prepared to rethink some of my processes I currently use. I will be authentic but accept that I will be changing some of my own behaviors, attitudes and actions. I like the following quote and apologize for not knowing the author.
          </p>
        
        <div>
          <q>Everyone wants to change the world but nobody wants to change themselves.</q>
        </div>
        <br>
    
   <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">My Expectations</h3></div>
          <p>
            The EDA has far exceeded my expectations.My belief is the EDA is cultivating a culture and a set of values that work, that I respect and want to be part of it. I expect to 'trip up' and make mistakes along the way - I already have in the last few days. Have asked for help and received it graciously - I hope. I want to be available if anyone calls on me for my help. I am prepared to be humbled but within the knowledge that I am with the best bunch of people to help me along my journey. At times I may falter so I hope to receive a gentle prod in the right direction.
          </p>
       
    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Am I Excited? Am I Nervous?</h3></div>
          <p>
            I told myself before starting Phase-0 (and will probably remind myself often) go in with an open mind and heart. Focus on the now! And Louise don't forget to breathe. That is the nervs. Yes I am nervous - but it is excited, eager, wide-eyed anticipation nervousness that I come with. I have been handed this wonderful opportunity and it will be a privilege to be part of the EDA environment.
