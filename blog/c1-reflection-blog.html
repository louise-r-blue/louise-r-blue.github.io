    <h1>Lou's Fireside Reflection</h1>
    
     <p>My take is that I am so grateful we have these brilliant coaches, mentors, teachers and guides who believe in us, who will give us their all, so we can give 100%+ </p>

     <p>My impression right now is - I am thinking this is actually happening, I am really here, part of a fabulous team of people, better wake up a little more Louise, open your eyes and ears and give that brain a workout</p>

     <p>I am going to engage in this culture by being prepared to rethink some of my processes I currently use. I accept that I will be changing some of my own behaviours, attitudes and actions. I like the following quote.</p>

     <p>"Everyone wants to change the world but nobody wants to change themselves"</p>

     <p>My belief is the EDA is cultivating a culture and a set of values that really works and I want to be part of it. I expect to 'trip up' and make mistakes along the way - I already have in the last few days. Have asked for help and received it graciously. I want to be available if anyone calls on me for my help. I am prepared to be humbled but with the knowlegde that I am with the best bunch of people to help me along my journey. At times I may falter so I hope I receive a gentle prod in the right direction.</p>

    <p>The EDA has far exceeded my expectations. I told myself before starting Phase-0 (and will probably remind myself often) go in with an open mind and heart. Focus on the now! And Lousie don't forget to breathe. That is the nerv's. Yes I am nervous - but it is excited, eager, wide-eyed anticpated nervousness that I come with. I have been handed a gift and it will be a priviledge to be in the EDA environment</p>
