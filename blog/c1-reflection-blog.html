    <h2>My Take on the EDA Experience</h2>
    
     <p>My take is that I am so grateful we have brilliant hard working coaches like Shereef, who believe in us and who guide us on our journey. The founders and coaches have identified a real need, developing a unique learning opportunity for those who dare! </p>

     <h2>My Impressions</h2>

     <p>My impression right now is - I am thinking this is actually happening, I am really here working with a fabulous team of people. I tell myself to open my eyes and ears.</p>

     <h2>How Will I Egage?</h2>

     <p>I am going to engage in this culture by being prepared to rethink some of my processes I currently use. I will be authentic but accept that I will be changing some of my own behaviours, attitudes and actions. I like the following quotes and apologize for not knowing the authors.</p>

     <q>Everyone wants to change the world but nobody wants to change themselves.</q><br><br>

     <q>When the student is ready the teacher appears</q>

     <h2>Have my Expectations of EDA Changed?</h2>
     
    <p>My belief is the EDA is cultivating a culture and a set of values that work, that I respect and want to be part of it. I expect to 'trip up' and make mistakes along the way - I already have in the last few days. Have asked for help and received it graciously - I hope. I want to be available if anyone calls on me for my help. I am prepared to be humbled but within the knowlegde that I am with the best bunch of people to help me along my journey. At times I may falter so I hope to receive a gentle prod in the right direction.</p>

    <h2>Am I excited? Am I Nervous</h2>

    <p>The EDA has far ex?ceeded my expectations. I told myself before starting Phase-0 (and will probably remind myself often) go in with an open mind and heart. Focus on the now! And Louise don't forget to breathe. That is the nervs. Yes I am nervous - but it is excited, eager, wide-eyed anticpated nervousness that I come with. I have been handed this wonderful opportunity and it will be a priviledge to be part of the EDA environment.</p>
