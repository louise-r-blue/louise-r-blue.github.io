            A responsive site is one which adjusts and scales appropriately to the users choice of device and screen resolution. The device could be a smart-phone, tablet or desktop and screen resolutions range from 360px x 598px, 600px x 960px to 1280px x 1024px respectively.
            The 'px' is a pixel - like a cube and is pixels per screen inch. A responsive site uses one set of code to service all the users devices and screen resolutions. A site must also take in to consideration the users viewing environment - such as indoor and  outdoor conditions, slow and fast connection speeds.

            Responsive sites are becoming increasingly important as users are accessing a varied and growing range of devices. One of the challenges for a responsive site is with mobiles and touch screens. Users use fingers as navigational tools on a mobile - choice of button size and position becomes paramount.

           Mobile first means web sites must design and develop with mobile the first consideration as it is the most challenging device to provide for. Mobile sites must be accessible and inviting to users. This is where responsive design is paramount and involves reshaping and redesigning content with mobile friendly page layouts and color.

            Imagine frameworks are like the foundation and wall structure of a new building. These frameworks opt to provide a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria to address common problems. As with a buildings structure and foundation there are industry conventions and processes to follow. There are different frameworks to suit web sites catering for size and purpose just as there is different foundations and structures to suit a buildings purpose, size and environment. Think of frameworks, foundations and structures as reference tools that assist us in finding solutions to common problems.

            There are many frameworks available and choosing the best one is a challenge. Frameworks cater for the 'front-end' '(basically the user interface), 'back-end'-what the user generally does not see on the server side, simple and complete options as well. Responsive frameworks are now becoming increasingly important. All frameworks consists of a package of files, folders and the standardized code.

            Some pros of frameworks is the streamlined common structure, code reuse, clean and tidy code, saves time, perhaps saves money, coders do not work from scratch, projects easier to maintain, browser compatibility and long-term support.

            Some possible cons of frameworks is the streamlined common structure could mean you miss out on other resources, some are complex and difficult to get to 'grips' with, unused code is left over, there is a slow learning curve and coders do not learn to do it themselves.

            Wireframes are basic linear sketch-ups of web pages that make up a web site. With little to no text they provide the developers and designers a visualization of a pages starting point. The designer/developer looks for all the boxes he/she sees on a mock-up page and uses this as a guide for the wireframe sketch. Nothing is set in stone so these wireframes can be modified at any time during the design and development process.
