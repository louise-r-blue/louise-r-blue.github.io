      <h3 class = "para-header">The Relationship Between Mindfulness and Self-awareness</h3></div>
  
          <p>
            Both mindfulness and self-awareness have similar traits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Self-awareness is the (trainable) ability - enabling us to look at ourselves objectively, for example during an emotional confict - how do we deal with our emotional responses to this event.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mindfulness also practices this, but I think with a more purposeful and meaningful approach. The mindful person is attentive and focused on one particular moment or event without being rash or too quick too judge.
          </p>

    <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Self Awareness Practice</h3></div>
    
          <p>
            Firstly I tried the 2 minute body scan. I liked this and would do again. I would use the book to follow the instructions -  because it feels like I am receiving wise instructions to build a good habit.
          </p>

          <p>
            I then practiced the 2 minutes of journalling - choosing 'What am I feeling now is..'. I am not surprised I managed to write so much. I feel much is going on that is reflected in my feelings about the 'much' that is going on. Now that sounds like a bad case of recursion. Mme perhaps for me it is about seperating the feeling from the thinking.
          </p>
             

      <div class = "blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">My Emotions are not Me</h3></div>
          
          <p>
            My emotions are changeable and define a small part of the inner at some point, they do not define  the physical me.
          </p>
            What emotions I may have had in the pass have no bearing on my emotions now or in the future.
          <p>
