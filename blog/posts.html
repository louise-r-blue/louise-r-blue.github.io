        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
          <p>Over a year ago I graduated from an excellent training facility that has helped shape my developer skills and mindset. I have had the good fortune to complete some contract work since then but now I seek to nail that next role.</p>
      <p>I  am writing this for other graduate developers to read (and maybe learn from) as they commence their new career. It is not my intention or desire to deride any person or organization nor do I wish to impress or annoy. For the record I will be not be mentioning any person or organization by name. They will simply be referred to as the 'the Man' - could be a man or woman and could be more than one person or organization.</p>
        <p>Mostly I will just poke fun at myself for being really stupid at times and sometimes for just being me.</p>
        <p>You may feel me a bit reckless - may I not be jeopardizing any possible job opportunity? You could be right but this is a time I need to follow my intuition.</p>
      <p> Less than two weeks ago I would not have written any of this but what I needed was content for this site. I did not want to discuss code or technologies just yet as that is an experience in the making. You will find far better code development resources elsewhere if that is what you seek.
      You will not find anything extraordinary here but there is a parallel site in development where I experiment with code and technologies.</p>
        <p>What I can discuss here is some of my wide range of experiences that I know so very well.</p>
        <p>There is no writing plan of endless notes I have taken - I have an excellent memory.</p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">the Interview</h2>
        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>These are actual interviews I have had the honor of attendling. 'the Man' is either a man or women, an organization or could be more than one person.</p>
        <h3>White boarding</h3>
        <p>'the Man' asked me to whiteboard the part of an application I had worked on. I was also to give a spoken description as I whiteboarded. Feeling rather confident of my skills and knowledge I proceeded with great vigor. 'the Man' - a forensic analyst pursued my sketch and words like a hound. I then had a vague recollection of a time long ago when I gave a piano recital. On completion of this recital I went to rise and meet the audience only to discover my right leg had gone dead - like really numb. I fell flat on my face. Suddenly back in the now I tried to contain my thinking. I could clearly see what I wanted to say but my hands would not write and any vocabulary had deserted me. That was the end of that interview.</p>
        <p>Note: I wish to thank that particular 'the Man'. 'the Man' highlighted my many areas for improvement - like know your CV really well. You might indeed have done all you said but how well can you articulate it. I felt upset at my own foolishness for a bit - but mostly I just felt relief, knowing I had not found the right job yet.</p>
        <h3>the silent one</h3>
        <p>Entry level programmer wanted. 1 hour and 15 minutes of near silence. 'the Man' occasionally glanced in my direction and remarked about something on my CV. In fear of losing any vocal capabilities I remarked of the only white board in the room and what was clearly a programmer's scrawl. Is that VB.Net I inquired? 'the Man' said 'the Man' had no idea as 'the Man' was not a programmer, couldnt understand any of it as 'the Man' was the IT manager and had been for 30 years.</p>
        <h3>Body language</h3>
        <p>'the Man'invited me to an interview located at the 'the Man' cafe. 'the Man' proceeded to greet everyone in the cafe, cafe workers and all - but not me. Eye contact was fleeting. Eventually 'the Man' asked me a question but I could not be sure if this was meant for me as 'the Man' sat side on, legs crossed away from me - projecting their voice away toward a vending machine. Perhaps 'the Man' was trying to make contact with the vending machine - get it to rise up. Should I mirror 'the Mans' body language or could I try stare 'the Man' out to get some kind of recognition? I could sit on the vending machine. Would 'the Man' even notice?
</p>
        <h3>Noise pollution</h3>
        <p>You may find yourself in a noisey environment like a cafe. If you are good at lip reading then great, otherwise nod no when 'the Man' nods no and nod yes when the 'the Man' nods yes. Another strategy is to lip sync (this way you get to say little, if nothing) but you can be sure that 'the Man' can't hear you anyway, even if you actually speak.</p>
        <h3>Integrate - the group interview</h3>
        <p>Accepting the invitation to go down the 'the Man' slide I realized I was last to go. It took me a week to catch up with the rest of the group and 'the Man' as they made a reconnaissance of 'the Man' facilities - (OK a slight exaggeration but you get the picture. I'm not slow, just careful). Wanting to integrate, like stealth I kept a watchful eye on the group and 'the Man'. This is a perfect time for lip reading. Through the noise and hustle I could interpret what was being said from 10 meters away.</p>
        <h3>Gobble gobble</h3>
        <p>'the Man' was famished and needed to eat. Would I like a coffee? Yes please. 'the Man' proceeded to tell me 'the Man' was a gobble gobble mathematician. Sorry did you say magician? Gobble gobble no mathematician gobble.</p>
