        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
          <p>Over a year ago I graduated from an excellent training facility that has helped shape my developer skills and mindset.</p>
          <p>I have had the good fortune to complete some contract work since then but now I seek to nail that next role.</p>
      <p>I  am writing this for other graduate developers to read (and maybe learn from) as they commence their new career. It is not my intention or desire to deride any person or organization nor do I wish to impress or annoy. For the record I will be not be mentioning any person or organization by name. They will simply be referred to as the 'the Man' - could be a man or woman and could be more than one person or organization.</p>
        <p>Mostly I will just poke fun at myself.</p>
        <p>You may feel me a bit reckless - may I not be jeopardizing any possible job opportunity? You could be right but this is a time I need to follow my intuition.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago I would not have written any of this but what I needed was content for this site. I did not want to discuss code or technologies just yet as that is an experience in the making. You will find far better code development resources elsewhere if that is what you seek.
      You will not find anything extraordinary here but there is a parallel site in development where I experiment with code and technologies.</p>
        <p>What I can discuss here is some of my wide range of experiences that I know so very well.</p>
        <p>There is no writing plan of endless notes I have taken - I have an excellent memory.</p>

        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>These are actual interviews I have had the honor of attendling. To reiterate 'the Man' is either a man or women, an organization or could be more than one person.</p>
        <h3>White boarding</h3>
        <p>'the Man' asked me to whiteboard the part of an application I had worked on. I was also to interpret aloud as I whiteboarded. Feeling rather confident of my skills and knowledge I proceeded with great vigor. 'the Man' - a forensic analyst pursued my sketch and words like a hound. I then had a vague recollection of a time long ago when I gave a piano recital. On completion of this recital I went to rise and meet the audience only to discover my right leg had gone dead - like really numb. I fell flat on my face. Suddenly back in the now I tried to contain my thinking. I could clearly see what I wanted to say but my hands would not write and any vocabulary had deserted me. End of interview.</p>
        <p>Note: I wish to thank that particular 'the Man'. 'the Man' highlighted my many areas for improvement - like know your CV really well. You might indeed have done all you said but how well can you articulate it. I felt upset at my own foolishness for a bit - but mostly I just felt relief, knowing I had not found the right job yet.</p>
        <h3>the silent one</h3>
        <p>Entry level programmer wanted. 1 hour and 15 minutes of near silence. 'the Man' occasionally glanced in my direction and remarked about something on my CV. In fear of losing any vocal capabilities I remarked of the only white board in the room and what was clearly a programmer's scrawl. Is that VB.Net I inquired? 'the Man' said 'the Man' had no idea as 'the Man' was not a programmer, couldn't understand any of it as 'the Man' was the IT manager and had been for 30 years.</p>
        <h3>Body language</h3>
        <p>'the Man'invited me to an interview located at the 'the Man' cafe. 'the Man' proceeded to greet everyone in the cafe but not me. Eye contact was fleeting. Eventually 'the Man' asked me a question but I could not be sure if this was meant for me as 'the Man' sat side on, legs crossed away from me - projecting their voice away toward a vending machine. Perhaps 'the Man' was trying to make contact with the vending machine - get it to rise up. Should I mirror 'the Mans' body language or could I try stare 'the Man' out to get some kind of recognition? I could sit on the vending machine. Would 'the Man' even notice?
</p>
        <h3>Noise pollution</h3>
        <p>You may find yourself in a noisy environment like a cafe. If you are good at lip reading then great, otherwise nod no when 'the Man' nods no and nod yes when the 'the Man' nods yes. Another strategy is to lip sync (this way you get to say little, if nothing) but you can be sure that 'the Man' can't hear you anyway, even if you actually speak.</p>
        <h3>Integrate - the group interview</h3>
        <p>Accepting the invitation to go down the 'the Man' slide I realized I was last to go. It took me a week to catch up with the rest of the group and 'the Man' as they made a reconnaissance of 'the Man' facilities - (OK a slight exaggeration but you get the picture. I'm not slow, just careful). Wanting to integrate, like stealth I kept a watchful eye on the group and 'the Man'. This is a perfect time for lip reading. Through the noise and hustle I could interpret what was being said from 10 meters away.</p>
        <h3>Gobble gobble</h3>
        <p>'the Man' was famished and needed to eat. Would I like a coffee? Yes please. 'the Man' proceeded to tell me 'the Man' was a gobble gobble mathematician. Sorry did you say magician? Gobble gobble no mathematician gobble.</p>

        <p>This could be for potential interviewers preparing questions for me. I have prepared some answers based on real questions from previous interviews to save you time and scarce resources. Please note this is not a comprehensive list. </p>
        <p>To reiterate the interviewer is 'the Man' - could be a man or a woman and could be more than one person.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Q.1</h3>
            <p>'the Man' - if you could be an animal what would you be and why?</p>
            <p>Me - I would be an Elephant, gracious and proud (not too proud), they lead their young to water, visit the graves of their dead and there is not too many left on earth.</p>
            <p>The 'the Man' wanted to debate me with this knowledge. 'Is this proven?' - 'the Man' asked.</p>
            <p>Me - why yes I have listened, watched and read excellent reports from renown scientists and researchers, professional people in their fields of study much like yourself. Can I jot down your reply for future reference?</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Q.2</h3>
            <p>'the Man' - what's your favorite TV show and why?</p>
            <p>Me - Fortitude, seasons 1 and 2. I am not going to give the why away. If you care about the future world I recommend you watch it for yourself.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Q.3</h3>
            <p>'the Man' - tell 'the Man' about a mistake you have made and what you learned from it?</p>
            <p>Me - I was asked to be leader of 'the Man' team. I did not want to lead. 'the Man' team was difficult. 'the Man' team did not want to listen to me, contribute or do the hard graft to reach our goal. With a fear of looming failure I started to lead. I pulled on 'the Mans' likes and what 'the Man' was better at doing. 'the Man' team was very successful.</p>
          </li>
            <li><h3>Q.4</h3>
              <p>'the Man' - what gets you out of your bed in the morning?</p>
              <p>Me - I love a challenge.</p>
            </li>
              <li><h3>Q.5</h3>
                <p>'the Man' - do you have any weaknesses?</p>
                <p>Me - I sometimes (very rarely) have a tendency to waffle - that is why I am keeping this short.</p>
              </li>
              <li><h3>Q.6</h3>
                <p>'the Man' - what do you do when your not coding?</p>
                <p>Me - I like to write.</p>
              </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes for interviewies</h3>
        <p>Most of us will know the behavioural (one dictionary definition - response of an organism to a stimulus) type interview question like the ones above. To help us we could have an assistant like 'Man behave'.</p>
        <h3>'Man behave'</h3>
        <p>'Man behave' is an app made for users - people like you and me. 'Man behave' has a feature that deciphers particular words or whole sentences posed as questions. All the user has to do is input answers to all the behavioural questions ever asked. We the user will supply a few answers per question. We will also describe the why. 'Man behave' has the answers queued so only needs to pop one off or do a random selection. 'Man behave' speaks the answsers aloud so you don't have to. At the interview you make 'the Man' aware of 'Man behave' - does 'the Man' mind if you trial this new app?</p>

        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>A smart brother said to me - your cv is a sales document - you need to sell yourself. Fact one - I couldn't act to sell or save myself.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hitch hiked around Europe alone - wouldn't do it now.
          </li>
          <li>
            Part of role in a job I once had, required that I search for bomb devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Walking in Scotland I fell and was sucked into a peat bog. My friend wouldn't help me out as she was in hysterics - with laughter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrote and gave a speech about climate change - I was the characters winter, summer, autumn and spring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saved a women from choking to death by giving her the Heimlich Maneuver.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slept on a beach one night. When I woke, a sign read 'Murderer's Bay'.
          </li>
          <li>
           I believe saying 'learn from us - we are good at what we do' is more credible than claiming - 'learn from us - we are the best in the business'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show me - don't tell me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now and again I need to practice mindfulness.
          </li>

        <h2 class="section-heading" id="collapse24">Be mindful</h2>
        <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>&#32;By LRB Oct 2017.</h5>
        <hr>
        <h3>Thinking can be dangerous</h3>
        <p>Walking home one night from work I was three or so meters from my front door. I was thinking hard on how I could improve on my work performance. It took one missed step for me to trip and do a 'face plant' against the side of the house. Burst  my lip, lost a tooth and my pride. I was in great pain. The message here is leave your work at work and focus on the now.</p>
        <h3>Use it or lose it</h3>
        <p>You have to make an effort to look after yourself when job hunting. I can be lazy when it comes to exercise. Last week I had two appointments a block apart. I drove and parked in the middle of the block. Returning to the car after the first appointment I then drove about 20 meters to a park closer to the next appointment.</p>
        <h3>Age</h3>
        <p>Don't let age be a barrier to hiring me. I was stopped in the street by a man soliciting for signatures. He said to me 'Are you 18 and if so can you sign this form?. I said 'No sorry - I just look mature for my age'.</p>
        <h3>Carrots</h3>
        <p>Most vegetables are good for you. Apparently eating carrots can help maintain good eyesight. I once heard of someone who ate nothing but pumpkin soup for a week. They couldn't understand why their skin had turned a shade of orange. Too much of a good thing or too good to be true. Be mindful of 'the Man' who teases you with a carrot. Do nothing until you have it signed sealed and delivered - then you will know it is true. For us graduates it is also good practice never to make offers unless you are certain you can commit 100%.</p>
        <h3>Best or better</h3>
        <p>Regarding the last point in the random facts section above. I was researching 'the Man' in preparation for an interview. 'the Man' claimed to be 'the best in the business...come learn from us...'. I studied one of 'the Man' websites. This website had a feature that allowed the user to find a particular vendor. I happen to know one of the listed vendors is a 20 minute walk from my home. However the website had me starting my journey up the west coast and informed me it would take 13.5 hours to walk to this vendor. I think it is better to say 'We are good at what we do...Louise or you, come work with us and help make us better...' or something like that.</p>
        <p>I could do better. LinkedIn has informed me my profile photo does not follow their current standards. Admittedly the photo is a grainy black and white holiday snap. I will make an effort to change it - soon.</p>
