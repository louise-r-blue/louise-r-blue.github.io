          <p>
            Today one task was to implement a function (like a dish-washer that is built to wash dishes very well &amp; only dishes), that would take in a word/s &amp; determine if a particular letter was present in this word/s  - &amp; the total letter count. Then the next step was to implement another function that took in a word &amp; a letter to test it against providing a letter count as well. Well I do not know why but the first function with one tiny change was able to provide for this test. Yet I hammered away trying to find a different approach when it was right in front of me. However the concluding function was an eloquent enough attempt for a novice. I suppose the lesson learned would have to be do not make it any more complicated than need be. Think simple &amp; look at what you have got already.          </p>

      <h3 class = "para-header">Reflecting on Confident use of Problem Solving Techniques</h3></div>
    
          <p>
            Overall I feel fairly confident with my problem solving techniques so far including the following.
          </p>
              <ul>

                  <li>Psuedocode:  I write false code a lot in a scrawl only I can understand.</li>
                  <li>Trying Something:  Sometimes a little tentative but fine about trying something</li>
                  <li>Rubber Duck Method:  Very cute &amp; will consider such a device.</li>
                  <li>Reading Error Messages:  Getting better &amp; if I do not understand I Google.</li>
                  <li>Console Logging:  I make good use of this technique</li>
                  <li>Googling:  Know what &amp; how to search</li>
                  <li>Asking Peers for Help:  Probably not so confident as I feel sometimes I am not sure what I want to ask</li>
                  <li>Asking Coaches for Help:  As above</li>
                  <li>Improving processes with Reflection:  This I can improve &amp; need to dedicate more time to.</li>
                  
              </ul>

          <p>
            The map() method is an iterator looping over items &amp; performing an action on each. Given a selection of items - for instance you lay out slices of bread with your aim being to manipulate the slices by providing ingredients &amp; packaging them differently to when they where slices of bread in a plain loaf.
          </p>

          <p> 
            The filter() method as above is an iterator performing an action - in this case a condition on each item &amp; returns only the items that meet the condition. An example would be when you decide to replenish your array of socks. You lay them out inspecting for wear-ability. Your condition is: if none have holes - keep, if any have holes - bin them.
          </p>
       
          <p>
            The reduce() method is a mathematical iterator reducing a selection of items to one. I suppose I can mention the making of pizza dough again. You have measured ingredients laid out, &amp; to make a whole ball of dough you methodically add the ingredients till all is one.
          <p>

      <div class="blog-header">
      <h3 class = "para-header">Recursion Explained</h3></div>
  
          <p>
             Ever had a recurring problem &amp; you did not know how to fix it. If you were cycling down a hill &amp; your brakes failed you would be mad (&amp; scared) that you did not attend to the maintenance of your bicycle brakes. Recursion in programming is where a function like I described above with the washing machine but this time the washing machine calls it self again &amp; again - well it does not stop till it explodes. A recursive function calls it self again &amp; again but has (coded) brakes that allows the function to stop processing. Users of the code would be none to happy running a recursive function that did not brake.
