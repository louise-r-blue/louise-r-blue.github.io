          <p>
            Today one task was to implement a function (like a dish-washer that is built to wash dishes very well and only dishes), that would take in a word/s and determine if a particular letter was present in this word/s  - and the total letter count. Then the next step was to implement another function that took in a word and a letter to test it against and provide a letter count as well. Well I do not know why but the first function with one tiny change was able to provide for this test. Yet I hammered away trying to find a different approach when it was right in front of me. However the concluding function was an eloquent enough attempt for a novice. I suppose the lesson learned would have to be do not make it any more complicated than need be. Think simple and look at what you have got already.          </p>

          <p>
            Overall I feel fairly confident with my problem solving techniques so far.
          </p>
              <ul>

                  <li>Psuedocode: I write pigeon english a lot in a scrawl only I can understand.</li>
                  <li>Trying Something: Sometimes a little tentative but fine about trying something</li>
                  <li>Rubber Duck Method: Very cute and will consider such a device.</li>
                  <li>Reading Error Messages:Getting better and if I do not understand I Google.</li>
                  <li>Console Logging: I make good use of this technique</li>
                  <li>Googling: Know what and how to search</li>
                  <li>Asking Peers for Help: Probably not so confident as I feel sometimes I am not sure what I want to ask</li>
                  <li>Asking Coaches for Help: As above</li>
                  <li>Improving processes with Reflection: This I can improve and need to dedicate more time to.</li>
